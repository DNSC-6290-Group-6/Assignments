# Group 6 Final Assessment 

### Introduction
* The purpose of this project was to implement an interpretable machine learning model that takes into consideration real-world problems in machine learning, such as security, privacy, and discrimination.
* The type of machine learning model that was used in this project was an explainable boosting machine model (EBM) which is a tree-based, cyclical gradient boosting generalized additive model (GAM) with automatic detection that is just as accurate as blackbox model while remaining interpretable. 
* The follwing group members that worked on developing the EBM model include Runzhe Tang, Qian Xie, and Matias Roca.
